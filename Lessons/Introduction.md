# Introduction

Ruby the language designed specifically for programmer happines.

Rails has been optimized for writing code faster and with fewer headaches, allowing you to iterate more frequently when building a website. Faster iteration means that the end product is more likely to suit the client's or user's needs, making your projects more successful.

## A brief history of Ruby

Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, or "Matz" in Japan in the mid 1990's. It was designed for programmer productivity with the idea that programming should be fun for programmers. It emphasizes the necessity for software to be understood by humans first and computers second.

The Ruby on Rails framework built with the Ruby language by David Heinemeier Hansson, introduced many people to the joys of programming in Ruby.

## Computers Science and Layers of Abstraction

In programming and computer science in general, there is a concept called _abstraction_. Abstraction ensures that as users, we're far removed from what's happening "under the hood".
A simple example will help illustrate this concept.

Every programming language is based on other lower level layers of code that make it easy to use. Another level of abstraction is how Ruby programmers use the Ruby programming language to design and build higher level languages called _Domain specific language_ or _DSL's_ like Rails. We do not necessarily need to know how these DSL's are implemented, but we know they exist and know how to use them.

As a beginner, you'll have to be aware of these abstractions particulary in programming and computer science and how they simplify programming and make computers easy to use.

It's often confusing, for example, read Rails or Rspec code without understanding Ruby because Rails and Rspec are DSL's operating at a higher level of abstraction.
